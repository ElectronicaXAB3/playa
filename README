 This project should end up with the following feature set:

   - a smallish and spartan music player that can work for weeks between charges.
   - decoding ogg files is a must.
   - microSD (SDHC) is the storage medium. so fat32 and cards bigger than 4G should be supported.


  there are 3 components in this repository:
  avr       - contains the Arduino code for the microcontroller
  hardware  - open source hardware for the main board (still in rough sketch form)


  Library dependencies for the avr code:
